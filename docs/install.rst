Installation
=============
The CodeGrade filesystem has to be installed and both the ``cgfs`` and the
``cgapi-consumer`` helper program must be available from the user's ``$PATH`` to
successfully install and use the CodeGrade editor plugins.

Installing the CodeGrade Atom Plugin (or CodeGra.Atom) can be done via the
command line or using the Atom GUI.

Installation via the command line is done
with the following command: ``apm install codegrade-atom``.

Installing using the 
Atom GUI can be done in the ``Install`` tab in the ``Settings`` or
``Preferences`` screen. Search for ``codegrade-atom`` in the search dialog and
press ``Install`` to install the plugin.
