CodeGrade Atom Plugin
======================================

Even though the CodeGrade filesystem works together with any editor by manually
editing its special files, it is recommended to use it in combination with
editor plugins. CodeGrade offers a package for `Atom <https://atom.io/>`__,
a recent but popular open-source code editor from the GitHub team.
This package is also known as *CodeGra.atom*.
