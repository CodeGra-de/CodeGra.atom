CodeGrade Atom Plug-in
======================================

Even though the CodeGrade filesystem works together with any editor by manually
editing its special files, it is recommended to use it in combination with
editor plugins. CodeGrade offers a package for `Atom <https://atom.io/>`__,
a recent but popular open-source code editor from the GitHub team.
This package is also known as *CodeGra.atom*.

The code of the CodeGrade Atom plug-in is open-source and can be found on
`Github <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.atom>`__.
